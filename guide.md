# pgvector Fundamentals Guide: Music Recommendation System

Hey there! 

Are you curious about pgvector but don't know where to start? This guide will teach you everything you need to know using a real music recommendation app as our example. 

Think of this as your friendly introduction to vector databases. We'll start with the basics ("What the heck is a vector anyway?") and work our way up to building production-ready applications. By the end, you'll understand not just how to use pgvector, but why it's so powerful for semantic search.

## What is pgvector?

Imagine you're building a music app and want users to search for "sad piano songs" or "upbeat workout music." Traditional databases can't understand the *meaning* behind these searches - they can only match exact words.

That's where **pgvector** comes in. It's a PostgreSQL extension that lets your database understand meaning, not just words. Here's what makes it special:

**Think of it like this:** Instead of storing just text, pgvector stores the "essence" of your data as numbers (called vectors). When someone searches for "sad piano songs," pgvector can find all songs that *feel* sad and feature piano, even if those exact words aren't in the song description.

### Why pgvector is awesome:

**Everything in one place:** Your regular data (song names, artists) and vector data live in the same PostgreSQL database. No need to manage separate systems.

**Rock solid:** PostgreSQL's reliability and ACID transactions protect your vector data just like regular data.

**Budget friendly:** No expensive vector database subscriptions. Use PostgreSQL you already know and love.

**Familiar tools:** Write regular SQL queries to search vectors. Your existing PostgreSQL skills transfer directly.

**Actually fast:** Built-in indexing makes vector searches lightning quick, even with millions of records.

## Understanding the Codebase

Before we dive into pgvector concepts, let's understand what each file in our music recommendation app actually does. Think of this as your roadmap to the code.

### The Main Files (What You'll Interact With)

**`app.py` - The Web Server**
This is your Flask web application. When someone visits the website or makes an API call, this file handles it. It's like the front desk of a hotel - it greets visitors and directs them to the right place.

```python
# What it does:
# - Serves the web page at "/"
# - Handles music recommendation requests at "/api/recommend" 
# - Provides health checks for monitoring
# - Connects the web interface to the recommendation engine
```

**`requirements.txt` - The Shopping List**
Lists all the Python packages our app needs to work. Think of it as a shopping list for your Python environment.

### The Smart Stuff (src/ directory)

**`src/config.py` - The Settings Manager**
All the app's settings live here. Database URLs, model names, API keys - everything configurable. It's like the control panel for your entire application.

```python
# What it manages:
# - Database connection details
# - Which AI model to use for embeddings
# - API keys for external services (like Kaggle)
# - Performance settings (connection pools, timeouts)
```

**`src/recommendation_engine.py` - The Brain**
This is where the magic happens! It takes your search query ("sad piano music"), converts it to numbers the database understands, and finds similar songs. It's the core intelligence of the app.

```python
# What it does:
# - Loads the AI model that understands text
# - Converts your search into vector numbers
# - Searches the database for similar songs
# - Returns ranked recommendations with similarity scores
```

**`src/database_setup.py` - The Orchestrator**
Think of this as the project manager. It coordinates all the database-related tasks: creating tables, loading data, generating embeddings. It makes sure everything happens in the right order.

```python
# What it orchestrates:
# - Creates database tables and indexes
# - Loads music data from external sources
# - Generates embeddings for all songs
# - Handles the entire database initialization process
```

### The Database Specialists (src/database/ directory)

**`src/database/schema_manager.py` - The Database Architect**
Creates and manages the database structure. It's like an architect who designs the building before construction starts.

```python
# What it builds:
# - Creates the songs table with vector columns
# - Sets up indexes for fast searching
# - Manages database schema changes
# - Verifies everything is set up correctly
```

**`src/database/embedding_processor.py` - The Translator**
Converts human-readable text into the numerical vectors that pgvector understands. It's like a translator between human language and computer language.

```python
# What it translates:
# - Song descriptions â†’ numerical vectors
# - Handles batch processing for efficiency
# - Normalizes vectors for accurate similarity
# - Inserts vectors into the database
```

**`src/database/data_loader.py` - The Data Collector**
Fetches music data from external sources (like Kaggle) and prepares it for our app. Think of it as a data journalist who gathers information from various sources.

```python
# What it collects:
# - Downloads music datasets from Kaggle
# - Cleans and processes raw music data
# - Creates rich descriptions for better search
# - Handles different data formats and sources
```

**`src/database/sample_data.py` - The Backup Plan**
Contains sample music data in case external sources aren't available. It's like having a backup generator when the power goes out.

### The User Interface

**`templates/index.html` - The Face of the App**
The web page users see and interact with. Contains the search box, results display, and all the visual elements.

**`static/` directory - The Styling**
CSS files for making the app look good, and JavaScript for interactive features.

### Now You're Ready!

With this roadmap, you'll understand which file does what as we explore pgvector concepts. Each file has a specific job, and together they create a complete semantic search application.

---

## Core Concepts

Now that you know what each file does, let's understand the fundamental concepts that make pgvector work. Don't worry - we'll explain everything in plain English!

### 1. Vectors and Embeddings (The Magic Numbers)

**What's a vector?** Think of it as a list of numbers that represents the "meaning" of something. Just like GPS coordinates tell you where you are on Earth, vectors tell you where your data sits in "meaning space."

**What's an embedding?** It's just a fancy word for "vector that captures meaning." When we convert "upbeat rock music" into an embedding, we get a list of 768 numbers that represents what that phrase *means*.

Here's how it works in practice:

```python
# Let's convert text to meaning-numbers
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
text = "upbeat rock music with guitar solos"
vector = model.encode(text)  # Magic happens here!
print(vector.shape)  # (768,) - that's 768 numbers representing the meaning!
```

**Why 768 numbers?** That's just how many the AI model needs to capture meaning accurately. Different models use different amounts - some use 384, others use 1024. More numbers usually means better understanding, but also more storage and computation.

### 2. Distance Metrics (How Similar Are Things?)

Once we have vectors, we need to measure how similar they are. pgvector gives us three ways to do this:

**Cosine Distance (`<->`)** - *The most popular choice*
Think of this like measuring the angle between two arrows. If they point in the same direction (similar meaning), the angle is small. If they point in opposite directions (opposite meaning), the angle is large.

```sql
-- Find songs most similar to our search
SELECT song_name, embedding <-> $1 as distance 
FROM songs 
ORDER BY embedding <-> $1 ASC  -- Smaller distance = more similar
LIMIT 5;
```

**Euclidean Distance (`<->`)** - *The straight-line distance*
Like measuring the straight-line distance between two points on a map. Closer points are more similar.

**Inner Product (`<#>`)** - *The dot product*
A mathematical way to measure similarity. Higher numbers mean more similar (opposite of the others).

**Which should you use?** For most text applications like our music search, cosine distance works best because it focuses on the direction of meaning rather than the magnitude.

### 3. Vector Normalization (Making Things Fair)

**What's normalization?** It's like adjusting the volume on different speakers so they're all equally loud. We adjust vectors so they're all the same "length" mathematically.

**Why normalize?** Without normalization, a long song description might seem more important than a short one, even if they mean the same thing. Normalization makes the comparison fair.

```python
import numpy as np

# Before: vectors might have different "lengths"
original_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

# After: all vectors have length 1 (normalized)
normalized_vector = original_vector / np.linalg.norm(original_vector)
```

**The result?** Now when we compare vectors, we're comparing their meaning, not their size.

---

## Database Setup

### 1. Enable pgvector Extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

### 2. Create Table with Vector Column

```sql
CREATE TABLE songs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    song_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    song_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    band TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding VECTOR(768),  -- 768-dimensional vectors
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- `VECTOR(768)` specifies exact dimensionality
- All vectors in a column must have the same dimensions
- Vectors are stored as PostgreSQL arrays internally

### 3. Create Indexes for Performance

```sql
-- Vector similarity index (IVFFlat)
CREATE INDEX songs_embedding_idx 
ON songs USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (lists = 100);

-- Traditional indexes for metadata
CREATE INDEX songs_song_name_idx ON songs (song_name);
CREATE INDEX songs_band_idx ON songs (band);
```

**Index Types:**
- **IVFFlat**: Approximate nearest neighbor, good for large datasets
- **HNSW**: More accurate but requires PostgreSQL 14+ and newer pgvector

### Code Implementation

```python
# From schema_manager.py
class SchemaManager:
    def __init__(self, vector_dimensions: int = 768):
        self.vector_dimensions = vector_dimensions
    
    async def create_database_schema(self, connection_pool):
        async with connection_pool.acquire() as conn:
            # Enable pgvector extension
            await conn.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;")
            
            # Create table with vector column
            create_table_query = f"""
            CREATE TABLE songs (
                id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                song_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                song_name TEXT NOT NULL,
                band TEXT NOT NULL,
                description TEXT NOT NULL,
                embedding VECTOR({self.vector_dimensions}),
                created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            );
            """
            await conn.execute(create_table_query)
            await self._create_indexes(conn)
```

## Embedding and Search

### 1. Model Selection

This project uses **sentence-transformers** with the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
# Produces 768-dimensional embeddings
# Good balance of quality and performance
```

**Popular Models:**
- `all-mpnet-base-v2`: 768D, high quality general purpose
- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`: 384D, faster but lower quality
- `multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1`: Optimized for question-answering

### 2. Creating Rich Descriptions

The key to good semantic search is creating descriptive text that captures meaning:

```python
def _create_enhanced_description(self, track_name: str, artist_name: str, row) -> str:
    """Create enhanced description for semantic search."""
    parts = [
        f"{track_name} by {artist_name}",
        f"artist: {artist_name}",
        f"song: {track_name}"
    ]
    
    # Add metadata if available
    if 'genre' in row:
        parts.append(f"genre: {row['genre']}")
    
    # Add decade information
    if 'year' in row:
        decade = f"{str(row['year'])[:3]}0s music"
        parts.append(decade)
    
    return " - ".join(parts)[:500]  # Limit length
```

**Example Enhanced Description:**
```
"Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen - artist: Queen - song: Bohemian Rhapsody - genre: Rock - 1970s music"
```

### 3. Batch Processing and Normalization

```python
class EmbeddingProcessor:
    def generate_embeddings(self, descriptions: List[str]) -> np.ndarray:
        """Generate normalized embeddings for song descriptions."""
        embeddings = self.model.encode(descriptions)
        
        # Normalize embeddings to unit length for proper cosine similarity
        for i in range(len(embeddings)):
            embeddings[i] = embeddings[i] / np.linalg.norm(embeddings[i])
        
        return embeddings
```

### 4. Database Insertion

```python
async def _batch_insert(self, songs: List[Dict], embeddings: np.ndarray, conn):
    """Perform batch insertion of songs and embeddings."""
    insert_query = """
    INSERT INTO songs (song_id, song_name, band, description, embedding)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5::vector)
    """
    
    for i, song in enumerate(songs):
        # Convert numpy array to PostgreSQL vector format
        embedding_str = '[' + ','.join(map(str, embeddings[i].tolist())) + ']'
        await conn.execute(
            insert_query,
            song['song_id'], song['song_name'], song['band'],
            song['description'], embedding_str
        )
```

**Key Points:**
- Convert numpy arrays to string format for PostgreSQL
- Use `::vector` cast to ensure proper type conversion
- Process in batches to avoid memory issues with large datasets

### Vector Similarity Search

### 1. Query Processing

```python
async def get_recommendations(self, query: str, limit: int = 5) -> List[Dict]:
    """Get music recommendations based on natural language query."""
    
    # Convert query to normalized embedding vector
    query_embedding = self.model.encode(query)
    query_embedding = query_embedding / np.linalg.norm(query_embedding)
    query_vector_str = '[' + ','.join(map(str, query_embedding.tolist())) + ']'
    
    # Perform semantic similarity search using pgvector
    search_query = """
    SELECT song_id, song_name, band, description,
           (embedding <-> $1::vector) as raw_distance,
           ROUND(CAST(GREATEST(0, (1.0 - (embedding <-> $1::vector) / 2.0) * 100.0) AS numeric), 1) as similarity_score
    FROM songs 
    ORDER BY embedding <-> $1::vector ASC
    LIMIT $2
    """
    
    results = await conn.fetch(search_query, query_vector_str, limit)
    return self._format_results(results)
```

### 2. Understanding the SQL Query

**Distance Calculation:**
```sql
(embedding <-> $1::vector) as raw_distance
```
- `<->` is cosine distance operator
- Returns value between 0 (identical) and 2 (opposite)

**Similarity Score Conversion:**
```sql
ROUND(CAST(GREATEST(0, (1.0 - (embedding <-> $1::vector) / 2.0) * 100.0) AS numeric), 1) as similarity_score
```
- Converts distance to percentage similarity (0-100%)
- Formula: `(1 - distance/2) * 100`
- `GREATEST(0, ...)` ensures no negative scores

### 3. Query Examples

```python
# Example queries and their semantic meaning:

"upbeat rock music" 
# â†’ Finds energetic rock songs

"sad ballad piano" 
# â†’ Finds melancholic piano-driven songs

"electronic dance 90s"
# â†’ Finds electronic dance music from the 1990s

"acoustic guitar folk"
# â†’ Finds folk songs featuring acoustic guitar
```

## Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration management. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/music_recommendations

# Model Configuration  
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL=all-mpnet-base-v2

# Kaggle API (Optional - for real dataset)
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_kaggle_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_kaggle_api_key

# Application Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-in-production
FLASK_DEBUG=True
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=5000

# Database Pool Settings
DB_MIN_POOL_SIZE=1
DB_MAX_POOL_SIZE=5
DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=30

# Recommendation Limits
DEFAULT_RECOMMENDATION_LIMIT=5
MAX_RECOMMENDATION_LIMIT=10

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Key Environment Variables:**

- **`DATABASE_URL`** (Required): PostgreSQL connection string with pgvector extension
- **`SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL`**: Embedding model name (affects vector dimensions)
- **`KAGGLE_USERNAME/KAGGLE_KEY`**: Optional for loading real music dataset
- **`SECRET_KEY`**: Flask session security (change in production)
- **Database Pool Settings**: Control connection pooling for performance

**Configuration Loading:**

```python
# From config.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()  # Load .env file

class Config:
    DATABASE_URL = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
    SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL = os.getenv('SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL', 'all-mpnet-base-v2')
    KAGGLE_USERNAME = os.getenv('KAGGLE_USERNAME')
    KAGGLE_KEY = os.getenv('KAGGLE_KEY')
    
    @classmethod
    def validate(cls):
        if not cls.DATABASE_URL:
            logging.error("DATABASE_URL environment variable is required!")
            sys.exit(1)
```

### 2. Connection Pooling

```python
# Efficient connection management
self.connection_pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    Config.DATABASE_URL,
    min_size=Config.DB_MIN_POOL_SIZE,    # 1
    max_size=Config.DB_MAX_POOL_SIZE,    # 5
    command_timeout=Config.DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT,  # 30 seconds
    server_settings={'application_name': Config.APP_NAME}
)
```

### 3. Error Handling and Graceful Degradation

```python
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    """Health check with database status."""
    try:
        stats = asyncio.run(recommendation_engine.get_database_stats())
        if 'error' in stats:
            return jsonify({
                'status': 'healthy', 
                'database': 'not_initialized',
                'message': 'App is running but database needs setup'
            })
        return jsonify({
            'status': 'healthy', 
            'database': 'ready',
            'songs': stats.get('total_songs', 0)
        })
    except Exception:
        return jsonify({
            'status': 'healthy', 
            'database': 'unknown',
            'message': 'App is running but database status unclear'
        })
```

### 4. Configuration Management

```python
class Config:
    """Environment-based configuration."""
    DATABASE_URL = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
    SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL = os.getenv('SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL', 'all-mpnet-base-v2')
    DEFAULT_RECOMMENDATION_LIMIT = int(os.getenv('DEFAULT_RECOMMENDATION_LIMIT', '5'))
    MAX_RECOMMENDATION_LIMIT = int(os.getenv('MAX_RECOMMENDATION_LIMIT', '10'))
    
    @classmethod
    def validate(cls):
        if not cls.DATABASE_URL:
            logging.error("DATABASE_URL environment variable is required!")
            sys.exit(1)
```

### 5. Monitoring and Statistics

```python
async def get_table_stats(self, connection_pool) -> dict:
    """Get statistics about the songs table."""
    async with connection_pool.acquire() as conn:
        count = await conn.fetchval("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM songs")
        size_result = await conn.fetchrow("""
            SELECT 
                pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('songs')) as total_size,
                pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('songs')) as table_size,
                pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('songs')) as indexes_size
        """)
        
        return {
            'row_count': count,
            'total_size': size_result['total_size'],
            'table_size': size_result['table_size'], 
            'indexes_size': size_result['indexes_size'],
            'vector_dimensions': self.vector_dimensions
        }
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Vector Dimensions

- **Choose consistent dimensions**: All vectors in a column must have same size
- **Consider model trade-offs**: Larger dimensions = better quality but more storage/compute
- **Popular sizes**: 384 (fast), 768 (balanced), 1024+ (high quality)

### 2. Distance Metrics

```python
# Use cosine distance for normalized embeddings (recommended)
embedding <-> query_vector

# Use L2 distance for non-normalized vectors
embedding <-> query_vector

# Use inner product for specific use cases
embedding <#> query_vector
```

### 3. Indexing Strategy

```sql
-- For datasets < 1M vectors
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (lists = 100);

-- For larger datasets
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (lists = 1000);

-- Tune lists parameter: sqrt(rows) is good starting point
```

### 4. Query Optimization

```sql
-- Good: Use index with ORDER BY + LIMIT
SELECT * FROM songs 
ORDER BY embedding <-> $1 
LIMIT 10;

-- Bad: Don't use WHERE with distance (bypasses index)
SELECT * FROM songs 
WHERE embedding <-> $1 < 0.5;
```

### 5. Data Quality

- **Rich descriptions**: Include context, metadata, synonyms
- **Consistent formatting**: Standardize text preprocessing
- **Embedding normalization**: Normalize for cosine similarity
- **Batch processing**: Process embeddings in batches to manage memory

---

## Troubleshooting

### Do's

1. **Normalize embeddings** for cosine similarity:
   ```python
   embedding = embedding / np.linalg.norm(embedding)
   ```

2. **Use connection pooling** for production:
   ```python
   pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(DATABASE_URL, min_size=1, max_size=5)
   ```

3. **Handle vector format conversion**:
   ```python
   vector_str = '[' + ','.join(map(str, embedding.tolist())) + ']'
   ```

4. **Create appropriate indexes**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX ON songs USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
   ```

5. **Validate dimensions** before insertion:
   ```python
   assert embedding.shape[0] == expected_dimensions
   ```

### Don'ts

1. **Don't mix vector dimensions** in same column
2. **Don't use WHERE clauses** with distance operators (bypasses indexes)
3. **Don't forget to normalize** when using cosine similarity
4. **Don't store raw embeddings** without proper formatting
5. **Don't ignore connection limits** in production

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Error: "dimension mismatch"**
```python
# Problem: Inconsistent vector dimensions
# Solution: Validate dimensions before insertion
if embedding.shape[0] != self.expected_dimensions:
    raise ValueError(f"Expected {self.expected_dimensions}D vector")
```

**Error: "index not used in query"**
```sql
-- Problem: Using WHERE instead of ORDER BY
-- Bad:
SELECT * FROM songs WHERE embedding <-> $1 < 0.5;

-- Good:
SELECT * FROM songs ORDER BY embedding <-> $1 LIMIT 10;
```

**Error: "connection pool exhausted"**
```python
# Problem: Not properly releasing connections
# Solution: Always use async context managers
async with self.connection_pool.acquire() as conn:
    # Use connection
    pass  # Connection automatically released
```

### Deployment on Render

This project is optimized for deployment on Render, a modern cloud platform that makes deploying pgvector applications straightforward.

### 1. Render Configuration Files

The project includes deployment configuration files:

**`render.yaml`** - Infrastructure as Code:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: music-recommendations
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app --workers 2
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: 3.11.0
      - key: FLASK_ENV
        value: production

databases:
  - name: music-recommendations-db
    databaseName: music_recommendations
    user: music_user
    postgresMajorVersion: 15
```

### 2. One-Click Deploy

Deploy directly from GitHub:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Click Deploy to Render** button (if available) or manually connect repository
3. **Render automatically**:
   - Creates PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
   - Sets up web service with proper Python environment
   - Configures environment variables
   - Deploys the application

### 3. Manual Render Setup

**Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Database with pgvector**

Render PostgreSQL databases support pgvector, but you need to enable it:

```sql
-- Connect to your Render PostgreSQL database
-- Method 1: Enable via SQL (recommended)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Verify pgvector is installed
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';

-- Check available vector functions
\df *vector*
```

**Render pgvector Setup Options:**

1. **Automatic Setup (Recommended)**:
   ```python
   # Your app automatically enables pgvector on first run
   # From schema_manager.py:
   await conn.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;")
   ```

2. **Manual Setup via Render Dashboard**:
   - Connect to your database using Render's built-in psql
   - Run: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;`
   - Verify with: `SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';`

3. **Using External Database Client**:
   ```bash
   # Connect using psql with Render's DATABASE_URL
   psql $DATABASE_URL
   
   # Enable pgvector extension
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   
   # Test vector operations
   SELECT '[1,2,3]'::vector <-> '[1,2,4]'::vector;
   ```

**Render pgvector Compatibility:**
- Render uses PostgreSQL 15+ which fully supports pgvector
- All pgvector operators (`<->`, `<#>`, `<=>`) are available
- IVFFlat and HNSW indexes are supported
- Vector dimensions up to 16,000 are supported

**Step 2: Create Web Service**
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app --workers 2`
- **Python Version**: 3.11+

**Step 3: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname  # Auto-generated by Render

# Optional (uses defaults if not set)
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMER_MODEL=all-mpnet-base-v2
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
FLASK_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Kaggle (optional for real dataset)
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_api_key
```

### 4. Render-Specific Optimizations

**Production WSGI Server:**
```python
# Uses gunicorn for production deployment
# Configured in start command: gunicorn app:app --workers 2
```

**Automatic Database Setup:**
```python
# App automatically initializes database on first run
# No manual schema creation needed
if __name__ != '__main__' and 'test' not in sys.modules:
    initialize_app()  # Auto-setup on Render deployment
```

**Health Checks:**
```python
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    """Render uses this endpoint for health monitoring."""
    return jsonify({'status': 'healthy', 'service': 'music-recommendations'})
```

### 5. Deployment Best Practices

**Environment Configuration:**
- Use Render's environment variable management
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Set `FLASK_ENV=production` for production deployment

**Database Considerations:**
- Render PostgreSQL includes pgvector extension by default
- Connection pooling is configured automatically
- Database backups are handled by Render

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use 2+ gunicorn workers for better concurrency
- Enable connection pooling (already configured)
- Monitor memory usage during embedding generation

**Monitoring:**
- Use Render's built-in logging and metrics
- Health check endpoint for uptime monitoring
- Database connection monitoring via `/api/status`


### Render Deployment Issues

**Common problems:** Build failures â†’ check requirements.txt | Database connection â†’ verify DATABASE_URL | Memory issues â†’ upgrade Render plan | pgvector missing â†’ contact Render support
